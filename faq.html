					<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
					<h3>Is Vex Email Free?</h3>
					<p>Yes! Currently we do not offer any additional paid tiers. We offer a 1GB mailbox at no charge which you can keep as long as you follow our <a target="_blank" href="/legal/EULA.txt">EULA</a>.</p>
					<h3>I Forgot My Password, How Do I Reset It?</h3>
					<p>If you have access to the recovery email address you provided during sign up you can change it !here!. If you did not provide a recovery email address, you will need to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@vex.email">support@vex.email</a>. You may be asked to verify information such as your full name, birthdate, and phone number. Alternatively, if you remember your password and you want to update it, you can do so !here!.</p>
					<h3>How Can I Update the Personal Information I Provided During Sign Up?</h3>
					<p>If you accidentally provided an incorrect birthdate, phone number, or recovery email during sign up contact us at <a href="mailto:support@vex.email">support@vex.email</a> as soon as possible to correct this information. You must make the request to update your information <strong>from your Vex Email address</strong>. If you loose access to your account you will not be able to update your information and consequently will not be able to recover a lost account.</p>
					<h3>What Is IMAP and How Can I Set It up on My Email Client of Choice?</h3>
					<p>Vex Email is proud to offer free IMAP access to your account. IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol, it is a way for your email app of choice to access your messages stored on our server. Instead of downloading emails to your device, IMAP keeps them on the server, allowing you to check your email from multiple devices while keeping everything in sync.</p>
